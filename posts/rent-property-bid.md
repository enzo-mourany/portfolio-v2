## Description

Rent Property Bid is a java application that takes the principle of AirBNB while adding features.
An owner posts an ad for an accommodation with a description, a type, a name and a starting price. People interested in this accommodation will bid above the price proposed by the owner, as well as the number of days they want to stay in the property.

Each owner has a portfolio containing all the properties that are available for rent.
The other users, the tenants, have a wallet with a sum of money to bid on.

It is possible for a user to have two accounts, an owner account and a tenant account.
There is also an Administrator account that allows to manage the accounts and the properties.
