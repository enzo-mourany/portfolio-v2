Tabata App is a simple application to create sport sessions with exercise duration and rest duration

## Why this project

Being an athlete myself, I often found myself in the situation where I wanted to do cardio or weightlifting sessions while being punctuated by a Tabata. I had to go on Youtube to put a video that cut every 2 minutes to start a commercial. I was going to tabata websites but the UI was very basic. I often ended up triggering a stopwatch on my smartphone while constantly scanning the timer.

I quickly realized that I was far from being the only one to face this problem. 

So I decided to develop a mobile application for Tabata.

I first hesitated about the technology I was going to use. Swift (IOS)? Java (Android)? 
I decided to use React Native which allows to create web applications. This option seemed to me the best.

I first developed this application in React Native Javascript, but after a few months without touching it, I had acquired skills in Typescript and therefore decided to completely redo the project.


## What I learned?

Thanks to this project, I learned how to use React Native and Typescript. I also learned how to build a mobile application with XCode and Android Studio.

## What's next?

The goal is to create a complete fitness application where you can create sessions with several exercises. Each exercise would have a duration, a rest time and a number of rounds.
It would be possible to save sessions to launch them quickly.
I also plan to add a sound indicator that will be activated each time the timer reaches 0.
