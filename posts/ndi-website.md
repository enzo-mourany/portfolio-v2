## Description

Every year in France, an event called "Nuit De l'Info" allows computer science students to form groups to participate in challenges proposed by companies.
For the 2022 edition, the organization has proposed the following challenge: Develop a website to raise awareness among young people about the dangers of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Some companies proposed challenges of cybersecurity or authentication for example.

We put together a team of developers (18 in one room) and we coded for 15 hours in a row (during the night of course).
We had a very precise organization:
- A group of frontend developers
- A group of backend developers
- One Designer
- Two reviewers on our Pull Request

During the first hour, we discussed the specifications and the ideas we had for the website.
We decided to create a platform of mini-games to teach in a playful way.

And it was off to an intense night with lots of caffeine!

In the room, there was a whiteboard that allowed us to draw the architecture of our project as well as a project management board with postits on which was written a stain. On this board there were 4 columns: 
- Todo
- WIP (Work In Progress)
- In Review
- Done
The Issues and Pull Request were of course linked to this table.

To date, we have been first on 3 challenges in France

## What I learned?

This project was a great opportunity to learn how to work in a team. I learned how to use Git and Github to collaborate with my teammates.


## What I did?

I was in charge of the frontend part of the project. I used React and SASS to create the components of the website.
