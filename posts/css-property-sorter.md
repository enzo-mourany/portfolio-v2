CSS Property Sorter is a simple extension to sort CSS properties in VS Code

This extension is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=enzomourany.css-property-sorter)

## Why this extension?

Most web developers produce untidy css code. "We add a property here, another one there, we end up getting lost and in the end our code is not really readable. Sometimes we even duplicate selectors.

Even if we are as careful as possible, we can still make mistakes.

That's why I had the idea to create this extension.
Two clicks and the problem is solved. All CSS properties of each selector are ordered in a standard order. 
The code is now readable and easy to debug.


## Why typescript?

I chose to use Typescript because after a few years of experience with Javascript, I find it very useful to have a type system.

It was a good choice for this particular project because I was able to use the same code for the extension and for the tests.
