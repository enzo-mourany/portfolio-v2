CookieBlocker is a simple extension to block cookies in Firefox

## Why this extension?

On many websites, pop-ups often appear asking us to accept "cookies".
We have the possibility to accept or configure them, sometimes to refuse them.
Few people set cookies or look for the refuse button which is almost invisible because it takes too much time.

The idea came to me to create a browser extension that would allow to automatically refuse cookies when possible and to configure them beforehand so that the choice applies to all pop-ups.
This will save time for people and not be disturbed by a pop-up that appears

## Why Javascript?

I chose to use Javascript because it is the language I know best and I wanted to create a browser extension.

## What I learned?

Thanks to this project, I learned how to create a Firefox extension. I also learned how to use the Firefox API and how to create a notification.

## How to install it?

1. Open Firefox
2. Click on the "Add-ons" button in the left menu
3. Search for "CookieBlock"
4. Click on "Add to Firefox"
5. Setup the extension
6. Enjoy !
