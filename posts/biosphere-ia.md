Biosphere7 AI is a game AI that I developed in Java. The goal of this project is to create a plant that can survive in a hostile environment. The plant must be able to reproduce and evolve to survive.

## Description

In 1987, the construction of Biosphere 2 began in Arizona. This project aimed at experimenting with an autonomous life base that could include humans, on Earth, in order to be able to adapt it to other planets. Two missions were carried out: one for 2 years between 1991 and 1993, and the other for 6 months in 1994. This experiment gave rise to many twists and turns, and highlighted the complexity of balancing such a system.

During 50 years some similar experiments were carried out, then a series of "Biosphere" projects was launched, leading to Biosphere 6, a building on Mars sheltering some plant species in a perennial way.

Then the Biosphere 7 project was launched, aiming to use these plants to build a larger building, which will be used to integrate the first animals. This project was developed by an alliance between two consortia, the Red Consortium and the Blue Consortium.

Although they are allied for the financing of this project, each consortium remains the owner of each plant that it sets up in Biosphere 7. The red and blue consortia are therefore in competition to obtain the most productive plants.

## Rules

Screenshot

The Biosphere7 game is a board game. It is played on a board with 14 squares on each side, whose rows are denoted from 'a' to 'n', and columns from 'A' to 'N'.

Two players compete: the red player and the blue player, each in turn. Thus, a game turn is only constituted by an action of one of the two players. The red player starts.

Each square can contain a plant, belonging to one of the two players, and of a certain species, for example an apple tree. Each plant has a certain vitality, between 1 and 9. For example a square can contain an apple tree owned by the blue player, with a vitality of 7.
